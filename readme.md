# Bioinformatics pipeline

This GitHub repository contains code for the bioinformatic analyses used in the paper (to be inserted here)

The analyses was mainly conducted on Cedar and Niagara HPC supported by the Digital Research Alliance of Canada. Most of the scripts were developed to be run as batch jobs on Slurm Wokrload Manager.
